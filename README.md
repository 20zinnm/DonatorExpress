What is Donator Express?

Donator Express allows members on your server to view and purchase ranks/items without any hassle. Users can choose to pay using different payment methods such as Bitcoin and PayPal.



Why Donator Express when you have BuyCraft?

First of all, Donator Express is completely free, ran by YOU the server owner. Unlike other plugins Donator Express uses "Tokens" which is virtual currency users need to purchase to buy donator packages (ranks/item packages) which you have setup for your server. The tokens are completely manageable and you control their distribution (example: 1 Token = $1 USD). YOU are the central bank their is no third party controlling the tokens, you are in full control and you decide initially how much 1 Token is worth. You can also give out tokens in-game to a player as a reward or accomplishment they may have made. Players automatically get ranked in-game once they confirm their purchase. Donator Express can run ANY set of console commands which you specify to be ran once a user confirms their purchase in the Donator Express web portal which is provided with the plugin.
